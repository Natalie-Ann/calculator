# TI-108 Calculator

This app was built to directly mimic the design and functionality of the Texas Instruments 108 calculator. It has basic arithmetic and memory (MRC, MR+, MR-) functionality, as well as specific key sequences used by the TI-108 model. This project was mainly built to practice learning CSS Grid and Flexbox.
