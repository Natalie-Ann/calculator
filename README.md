# TI-108 Calculator

TI-108 Calculator - a Texas Instruments TI-108 calculator emulator. 

This app was built to directly mimic the design and functionality of the Texas Instruments 108 calculator. It has basic arithmetic and memory (MRC, MR+, MR-) functionality, as well as specific key sequences used by the TI-108 model. This is a front end only project using HTML/CSS/JS that I built from scratch mainly to practice learning CSS.
